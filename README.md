# Emotion-Classifier
An image-based emotion classifier model

## Overview
This project utilizes a machine learning pipeline (the jupyter notebook) to train a classification machine learning model to differentiate between an image of a happy person and an image of a sad person.
This model is utilized by the python app to provide an interactive GUI through TKinter, in order for the user to upload their own images and test the classifier.
